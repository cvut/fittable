Fittable is lightweight JavaScript widget used for displaying timetables and calendars for various applications based on project [Sirius](http://github.com/cvut/sirius). Offers subtle, flat and intuitive user interface. And it should be **more fittable** than any other timetable widget :blush:

Using JavaScript ES6+ code (converting to ES5 using [https://github.com/6to5/6to5](6to5)) makes the widget ready for new technologies and development trends in JavaScript language.

Offers quick implementation into another applications through simple Javascript API layer. For more information how to use this widget, visit [our wiki](#).
